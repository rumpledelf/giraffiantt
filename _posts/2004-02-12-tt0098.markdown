Ah, 2004. The beginning of the end for this comic (it wasn't updated for 90% of 2004 and all of 2005). On the upside, I got a psychology diploma out of it. Now, let us speak no more of 2004. It was a Very Bad Year.

FYI, the 5 weeks was for Psychology 1001, which was held in the summer break instead of over an entire semester, for us foolish graduate students.
