I found this on a bit of paper on Aisha's window ledge this morning. Its the "etc" at the end that amuses me most. The pictures at the bottom are labelled "Tummy", "Homer" and "poo".

This reads: "<em>on the simpsons Homor saw a big big big donat big then him. he Disaded to eat it when he had finished he had to much to eat. he was as fat as Aishas house. etc</em>"


Translation: "<em>On The Simpsons Homer saw a big big big donut, bigger than him. He decided to eat it. When he had finished he had too much to eat. He was as fat as Aisha's house. Etc.</em>"
