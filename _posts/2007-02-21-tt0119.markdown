Puppy continually jumps fence. Neighbours say they are going to keep puppy tied up. Puppy jumps fence and kills chicken. We call the council dog person. Council dog person discovers neighbours have five unregistered dogs, including two of breeds that they aren't allowed to have. Neighbours no longer have dogs. We now have a lonely chicken with a lot of missing feathers.
