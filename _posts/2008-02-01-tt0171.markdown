We've had this big fat black spider in the bathroom window for years, happily munching on the flies and generally looking contented. I've not bothered to do anything about it because I don't like flies.


This week however, I noticed that there were <em>four</em> fat black spiders, each surounded by a cloud of tiny little baby black spiders. Well, enough is enough - one I can cope with, but when we're talking several hundred spiders living right next to my bathroom sink? I'm afraid it's time to get out the Mortein and spray, spray spray. RIP spiders.

And yes, my bathroom walls <em>are</em> a horid shade of sky blue.
