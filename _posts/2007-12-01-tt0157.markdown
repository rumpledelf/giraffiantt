Ever since Aisha lost her bottom teeth and realised that the Tooth Fairy gives her $2, she's been wiggling all her top teeth. This is all very well and good, except her top teeth weren't actually loose, so she's been wiggling them for almost an entire year. Net result is that she now has a horible looking grey tooth, and it hurts her to eat apples, corn on the cob etc. Desperate times call for desperate measures though, the dentist said if she doesn't get the three teeth she's been wiggling out within two weeks, they'll pull them all out. One hopes the injection hurts, and she doesn't start wiggling any of her other un-loose teeth.
