Tyneese spotted me first and went running for the rest of the class shouting "Baby! Everybody come look at the baby!" and next thing they were <em>all</em> there, and they all had to touch the baby, who was just trying to have a quiet snack while I was waiting for school to end. Just as well I'm not particularly squeamish about breastfeeding in public, and just as well there are only 6 kids in the primary school class.
