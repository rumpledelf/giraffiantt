This is a problem that is inflicted on any of us unfortunate enough to be larger than a D cup in a bra. Now, bring maternity into the picture and walk a few letters up the alphabet of cup sizes (ok ok, more than a few) and you're talking serious reinforcement, 10 different places to hook that baricade of 4 superstrength hooks, double layers at the front so you can unhook bits so your nipples stick out but the rest of you doesn't just fall back towards your navel ... and of course all these marvellous examples of modern engineering are hidden up the back of the lingerie shop and are generally only available in beige and white. Lace and black are reserved for those <em>small</em> sizes.
