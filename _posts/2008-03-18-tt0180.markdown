Aisha's jewellery box runneth over. She'd have more of this style of necklace, but she is incredibly good at breaking jewellery within a day or so of aquiring it, and then hiding the broken bits somewhere. Baba likes to give her jewellery at a whim too, so she's got quite the ludicrous collection of pretty wearable trinkets.

And yes, that is what she thinks is a smile. If you want a proper smile you have to pull faces at her, but in the absense of someone handy to pull faces over the photographer's shoulder, this is what you get.
