It should have occured to me that it wasn't the cold weather stopping them laying, they'd just found a really good place to hide them.

<h3>Addendum: [later in 2003]</h3>

After I found their hiding spot, they decided to lay under the cover of my 
tank pump. The result? Eggs in my underground rainwater tank. A month later, the water finally smells like water again.
