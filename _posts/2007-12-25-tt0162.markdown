You'll have to excuse me backposting for a bit, the house was overun by relatives, Christmas cheer and babies.


I'm not sure who got the most benefit out of the keyboard <em>on</em> Christmas day (if you get a new toy in the house you have to make sure it works well with all the old toys), but I'm sure Aisha will enjoy more than just the box it came in when she gets back from her holidays.
