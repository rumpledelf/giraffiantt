This is how we often end up in the early evening. Him with the cat finally getting to sleep on a person, and me with the baby having just finished a feed. When I'm not there, the cat tries to wheedle her way onto the same lap as the baby - a task that gets increasingly difficult, since the baby is growing and the cat has stopped.
