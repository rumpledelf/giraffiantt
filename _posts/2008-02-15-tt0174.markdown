So we bought a fridge from a shop 90km away. After pestering them for a few weeks they finally said they'd deliver it on the 18th of February. On the 14th, I got a call from someone in Port Lincoln (roughly 600km away) saying they'd got a fridge with my name on it delivered instead of theirs. So now, we're back to square one and waiting for them to ship us a new fridge out in a few weeks time. Radio Rentals - their slogan should be "Call us, because We Won't Call You."
