Well, that was fun. Rain comes, dumps several inches in an hour, which banks up next to our house, comes in and soaks the only three rooms in the house with nice carpet (our horible grey carpet remains dry). Our region made the news from all the flooding.


While we were running around outside like chooks with our heads cut off taking down fence sheets and digging channels to get the water out of the yard so it wouldn't go in the house, Ryan's parents were here for the <em>very first time ever</em>, furiously mopping up all the water that was coming in under the back door. And with us spending all of the next day madly taking all the furniture out of the wet rooms, chasing up the insurance company, taking the wet carpet and underlay out and then putting back enough furniture to sleep on, putting some of our fence back on, watching the council re-build all the roads that got washed away, giving the SES back their sandbags and generally not getting to sit down much, the poor in-laws didn't get much of a social visit in.


This happened on Tuesday ... today is Thursday. We are both very, very sore.
