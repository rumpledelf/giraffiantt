In Australia you get $4,000 for having a baby. Its called the 'Maternity Allowance' or more commonly the 'Baby Bonus' and was brought in as a substitute for legislating businesses to pay maternity leave to working mothers. It's having an interesting effect, mainly a jump in the birthrate to mothers under 20, and not much of an effect on upper class working women at all. Large department stores have been seeing a big increase in young mothers, babe in arms, buying plasma televisions.

And a quote from <a href="http://eherald.alp.org.au/articles/0606/magopine29-01.php">this article</a>:

<em>
Single mothers have been given a taste of the Coalition’s welfare reforms. From 1 July this year (2006), they will be forced off the sole parent pension and onto Newstart allowance when their youngest child turns eight. That’s a cut of $29 a week. They will be activity-tested to retain Newstart and if they do not meet the test they can be breached.
</em>

<em>
Yet, if they do find a job, they will begin losing Newstart allowance at lower levels of earned income than would be the case under the sole parent pension. And when they do start losing benefits, they will do so at a higher rate for each extra dollar earned. When account is taken of lost benefits, income tax paid, travel, work and child care costs, they will end up working for less than $3 an hour.
</em>

<em>
What is a rational response of a sole parent faced with these strong disincentives to work and a reduction in benefits when the youngest child turns eight? Have another baby – and pick up a bonus of $4,000 (soon to be $5,000) along the way! The sole parent’s problem is then solved for another eight years.
