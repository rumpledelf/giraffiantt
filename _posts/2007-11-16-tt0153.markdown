For a while there, I'd be at the receiving end of a million quite hefty kicks from the baby - but as soon as I tried to get Ryan to feel, the baby would instantly stop kicking and hide. Getting Ryan to put his hand on my tummy turned out to be <em>the</em> most effective way to stop from getting kicked.


And then the shyness wore off, and now the bump wriggles (and sprouts elbow and foot shaped bumps) enthusiastically no matter who is watching.
